ba04826.sub100.fasta

These sequences are from the skin, specifically the back. Students should be able to
tell that this is a skin site because it is 97% Actinobacteria. The back, in particular,
is considered an oily site and is dominated by the bacterial genus "Propionibacteria"
(also called Cutibacteria)

st06686.sub100.fasta

The sequences are from the stool. The dominance of Bacteroidetes (22%) and Firmicutes (74%)
is how you know.

to10842.sub100.fasta

This is the mouth (Tongue). Streptococcus (29%) is a common mouth bacterial genus.

vf03604.sub100.fasta

Skin, forearm. Again, you can tell it is skin because of the dominant Actinobacteria (63%).
Unlike the back, the forearm is considered more of a dry site and shows more diversity
of bacterial genera.
